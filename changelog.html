      Hello, everyone! Welcome to the first official build of Silly Melee! It's a mod made by Alpharad and MagicScrumpy with some assistance of Casey O'Rourke.
As we all know, this mod is very, very silly. Characters do things that they never should have been able to do.
Being that nobody needs to play this game competitively, these patch notes with lack technical changes in terms of BKB/KBG and just speak in plain English.
Without further adieu, let's get on with the show.
<br><br>

I would personally like to thank Nebtune for being such a heavy advocate of this mod.
Also, thank you to Mr. Meeseeks, Hona, JD, Typo, Dad, American Bowser, Junebug, and Rice for playtesting.
Another thank you to YouTubers: Keyori, Relax Alax, and Heeeww for making videos for this game.
Lastly, a HUGE thank you to Jackson Fall for being my best friend for many years and also for making this lovely website.
